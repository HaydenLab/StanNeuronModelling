The scripts here are specifically for fitting the Stan model to the Hayden lab data (data will be available online... eventually)

getNeuroRegressors.R gets the data (variables and firing rates) for all of the data sets that will be run, runs the regression, and saves the result in regdata.RData

FitRegressionData.R takes the regression coefficients spit out by getNeuroRegressors.R and fits them with the model. NOTE: This takes a long time. It saves the resulting Stan fits to 'fivekFits.RData'

makeTable.R takes the fits from FitRegressionData.R and makes a table of the models' weights for each set and saves it to weightsTable.csv

make_Figs.R takes the fits and the table and makes the paper figures
